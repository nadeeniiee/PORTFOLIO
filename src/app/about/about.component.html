      <p class="about-text">
        Hi, I’m Nadine, and ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated with technology and how it continues to shape the world around us. 
        My curiosity about how software works and my drive to create something meaningful through innovation led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        One of my biggest aspirations is to develop my own video game. 
        I’ve always admired how games can create lasting experiences for players with its stories, challenges, and emotions that stay with them long after playing. 
        My goal is to bring together creativity, problem-solving, and technical expertise to design a game that not only entertains but also inspires others, just as games have inspired me.
